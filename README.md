# LMRotationproject
#In this project, I developed a comprehensive system for a large retail company to optimize the frequency of product department rotations across its extensive network of stores. The challenge was to determine how often each department's products should be rotated (updated) based on a multitude of factors such as seasonality, regional demand, market trends, and more.
